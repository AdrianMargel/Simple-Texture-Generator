# Simple-Texture-Generator
Generates simple stone textures

This program uses a custom built cellular automata to procedurally generate stone tile textures. These textures can be generated at any size. Using many generated textures can create a tiled wall effect with infinite variation as every tile is unique.

I created this to explore practical applications of cellular automata. Although not extremely advanced it does work quite well as a proof of concept and may be useful in future game-like projects.

This code was written in fall 2017.
